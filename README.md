# Idea Generator App

This is a simple web app that gives the user a prompt that they have to write 10 ideas about. 

This is taken from an interview between Tim Ferris & James Altucher in "Tools of Titans" (page 246) where James talks about this practice to increase creativity. The idea is to strengthen your "idea muscle" by writing down ideas - good or bad. The more ideas you generate, the sooner you will find the really good ones. 
> "It's hard to come up with more than 3,000 business ideas a year. I'm lucky if I come up with a few business ideas. The key is to have fun with it, or else you don't do it." - James Altucher

## App

This app is built using **MaterializeCss**. It isn't currently built on any framework, but could be for authentication and data storing for returning users.
